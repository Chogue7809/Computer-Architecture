>Power supplies Units (psu)are do just what their names says, it supplies power to your computer and its various components. It converts AC power to low voltage DC power. You have to take into consideration how much voltage is required to run your components to determain the wattage of power supply to run everything. PSUs range from 400w all the way up to 2000w, but generally anywhere from 700w - 800w is good enough to run everything. PSU also comes with ratings from bronze to titaniaum that determain the efficency of the unit. There is also what is called Full, Simi, and Non Modular units. Non modular unit have all of the wire connectors coming directly out of the psu even though you may not need all of them. Simi modular general has the most common used wires coming from the psu and then you can add the additional ones that you need. A Full modular PSU doesnt have any wire coming out of it. This allows you to pick only the wires that you need and add more as you may need this. This is especially beneficial if you have limited space to hide the wires.
