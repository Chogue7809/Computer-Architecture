>The computer case is what houses all the components. Although a case is mostly an astetic choice the are some things to consider when purchasing one besides just looks.
Just like motherboards there are differnt size cases to fit them. They range from large towers to small form factors for those that dont have alot of room. You just need to make sure you get the right size case to fit your mobo. Another thing you have to concider is the air flow of the case. You want to make sure you will have enough airflow to keep your components from overheating, especially if you are using mostly fan to cool your pc. The last thing to consider but not as important as the others is will it have enough ports to support your needs beside the ones that will be used on the motherboard.
