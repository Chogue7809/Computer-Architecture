>The central processing unit or **CPU** for short is essential the brains of the computer. It is the single most important component in a computer. The cpu is responsible for processing all the instructions that come from programs, the operating system(OS), and other components in your computer. The cpu consists of cores, caches and graphics. 
>When it comes to the cores in your cpu, the more you have the better processing power and multitasking capabilities you have. In 2002, Intel introduced something called *Hyperthreading*. Essentually what hyperthreading does is trick your pc into having more cores than it really does so it thinks you have 2 cores instead of one. This is then multiplied by the actuall number of cores you have, so if your cpu has 8 core you computer will actually think there is 16. 
>CPU memory cache is a fast memory unit with the cpu itself. It is responcible for recieving the information sent by a controller, that is either located in the chip itself or the Northbridge chips on the motherboard, from the random access memory(RAM). It allows the cpu the capability of carrying out a large number of instruction. The are three levels of cache, L1, L2, and L3. L1 is the fastest of the levels and is a the top of the hierarcy, L2 is a slower than the L1 but is bigger in size, and L3 is larger than L2 but is by far the slowest. 
>As far as graphics go, some cpu's have intergrated graphics built into the chip, although this is mostly limited too small form factor pcs or laptops. While not as good as a discrete graphics card it would allow you to play games, but you would be limited to lower graphics settings, thus resulting in a less then optimum veiwing experience.
> When it comes to choosing a cpu you have a couple of options in either *Intel* or *AMD*. Then there is levels to each of those Like Intel has the I3, I5, I7, and I9 and Ryzen 3, 5, 7, 9, and Threadripper. It just a matter of determaining a budget and what it is you are needing it for. Intel is mainly geared toward gamers due to it performance, they tend to be more expencive compared to it counter part. Ryzen is a good price to performance and good if you are on a budget. When it comes to having to do multi-tasking Ryzen is a good choose due to the number of cores it has compared to Intel. Although it wasnt always like that, Ryzen has come a long way and is just as good, if not better in some situations, as Intel.
