>As you use your pc, the cpu will generate energy and heat up. This is why it is required to have a cpu cooler. Its job is to help regulate the temperature of the cpu. You also add thermal paste between the cpu and cooler to help disperse the cooling evenly over the cpu. If the cpu get too hot then it will decrease the life of it, and it will also cause the cpu to shut down. This is why there is a built in safety when plugging the cpu fan or cooler into the motherboard. If the motherboard senses a malfuntion in the cooler it will automatically shut down your pc. There are many differnt types of ways to cool down your cpu, complete water cooling (which can be expensive), AIO, or a Fan Cooler. The last two are general the most affordable and popular choices. Some AMD cpu already come with a fan cooler so you dont need to purchase a seperate one. Fan cooler are a great option, you just need to make sure you a good air flow case. They have a radiator block that is attached directly to the cpu and then a fan that blow air thru it. They also tend to be a little on the louder size. Which brings me to an AIO cooler also know as an all in one cooler. It is a continuous liquid loop that contains a cpu block and a radiatior that you attach fans to. These are a great option because they are great at cooling but they are also typically more on the quite side. There are 3 main option when puchasing an AIO - 120, 240, and 360. This just refers to the number of fans the radiator will hold 120 = 1 fan, 240 = 2 fans, and 360 = fans. This allows you the option to get the right size to fit your particular case.
