>Data Storage is essential for storing programs and files on your computer. Data storage comes in many differnt size capacities. The 3 major types of storage are Hard Drive (HHD), Solid State drive(SSD), and NVMe sata drives. The most cost effective of the 3 is the HDD. While cost effective, the tranfer and writting speed of it is slow. HDD consist of plates that the information is witten on and contain moving parts, because of this they are prone to failure.  They are nice if you have alot of photos or other small files that dont require alot speed to run because you can get alot of storage for a resonible price. The 2nd is the ssd and contain modules to store the information. THis allows the unit to be more resistant to physical movement because there isnt any moving parts like the HDD. The read and write speed is also faster than that of the HDD. THis makes them better for storing gaming and videos. The last one is the NVMe sata storage, while the most expensive also has the best read and write speed of the other 2. The other benifit is the plug directly into the motherboad, so there isnt any additional cords needed to connect them. The NVMe is ideal for operating systems, games, and video because they are able to send information the fastest to the cpu for processing.
