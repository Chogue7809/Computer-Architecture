>The graphics processing unit(GPU) is a dedicated graphics card that is responsible for rendering graphics and images and displaying them on your monitor. They speed up the process of creating and rendering computer graphics. They are much more powerful than the intergrated graphic you have. Some GPUs also have dedicated RAM that aid in the processing speed. Graphics cards are essential for gaming  enthusiasts and people that require video rendering. If not your games would be fuzzy and possibly unplayable and video rendering would take forever and you may not get a good feel for the look of what you are creating. Nvidia is the leader when it comes to producing GPUs but AMD radeon also has them. While the AMD card is not for everyone, someone not looking for the greatest card, it would have enough capability of get the job done. Of all the components for you computer the GPU will more in likely cost the most. The more graphics capability and dedicated RAM the more it is gonna cost you.
