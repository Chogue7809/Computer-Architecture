>Random Access Memory(RAM) allows you to perform tasks like loading applications, playing games, and even browsing the internet. It allows you to switch between these task quickly. RAM is the responcible for directing information stored on you storage devices to the cpu for processing. Gameing and design software require alot more ram to run smoothly, so you will want to take that into consideration when chooseing how much RAM to put into your pc. RAM comes in various sizes from 4GB all the way up to 256GB. General you want to install RAM in pairs of two called a *dual channel configuration*. If you are only using two sticks then generally you put then in slots 2 and 4. Another thing to consider when purchasing RAM is *RAM speed* and *CAS Latency*. RAM speed is self explanitory. It determains the speed it is able to tranfer information, so the higher the number the faster it will be. Latency refers  to the time delay between when a command is entered and when the data is available. When the memory is told to access a specific location, it has to go through what is called clock cycles in the *Column Address Strobe (CAS)* to get to that particular location and complete what is asked of it. When choosing RAM besides size you also want to look for high RAM speeds and low CAS Latency.
